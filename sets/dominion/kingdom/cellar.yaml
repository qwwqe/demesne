  effects:
    # the effects under 'action' are those which take effect if the card is played
    # as an action. some cards with multiple types have different effects if played
    # in difference stages (for example, Crown double-plays the effect of an action
    # card if played as an action, and double-plays the effect of a treasure card
    # if played as an action. in such a case, there would be two distinct definitions
    # of the card's effects)

          amount: any
      # draw the number of cards you discarded in the 'discard' step
      - draw:
          amount: $discard # this reads from the result of the 'discard' effect
