// A Card simltaneously represents the definition of a Demesne card and
// a particular, concrete instance of such definition.
//
// NOTE: When implementing functionality involving properties of concrete
// cards (such as tokens, counters or even other cards being placed on top of
// them), it may be more ergonomic to separate the definition and instance
// of a card.
type Card struct {
	// Id identifies a specific and concrete Card, such as one being held by a
	// particular Player or one currently in a Player's play area.
	// Two Card instances with the same Id shall be viewed as equivalent
	// for all purposes.
	Id string

	// Name identifies the abstract definition of a Card.
	// Any Card instances possessing the same Name should also possess
	// properties except for Id.
	//
	// NOTE: As mentioned above, it may be a more flexible design to
	// implement via separation of card definitions and insances.

// NOTE: Does a Pile need an Id?

	Faceup bool

	// Whether the number of cards in this Pile is known to all players.

	// NOTE: In certain cases it is disputed whether the size of a Pile
	// can be known by its owner but not by other players (i.e. a player's Deck).
	// This may require specification of a finer grain, such as by replacing
	// this field with CountableByOthers and CountableByOwner.
	Countable bool

	// Whether the cards in this Pile may be inspected at will by all players.
